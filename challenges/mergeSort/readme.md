# mergeSort    :

 Merge Sort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It divides input array in two halves, calls itself for the two halves and then merges the two sorted halves. The merge() function is used for merging two halves. The merge(arr, l, m, r) is key process that assumes that arr[l..m] and arr[m+1..r] are sorted and merges the two sorted sub-arrays into one. See following C implementation for details.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

Merge Sort Complexity
Time Complexity
Best Case Complexity: O(n*log n)
Worst Case Complexity: O(n*log n)
Average Case Complexity: O(n*log n)
Space Complexity
The space complexity of merge sort is O(n).
