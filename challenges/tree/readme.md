# Tree   :

in this challenge we do the tree and BST  , and these two type of data structure 

```
Node
The Node class is a new class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.
```

```
Binary Tree
A BinaryTree class that has a method for each of the depth first traversals called preOrder, inOrder, and postOrder which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.
```

```
Binary Search Tree
A BinarySearchTree class, it has a method named add that accepts a value, and adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree. It also has a method named contains that accepts a value, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.
```

## Challenge
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.
Create a BinaryTree class
Define a method for each of the depth first traversals called preOrder, inOrder, and postOrder which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
this Challenge take from me 60 min  to do it ,
i used node stack , binary tree m binary search classes to do  it  

## binarytree

* Big O for time is O(n) becuse it depend on the number of the nodes
* Big O for space is O(h) becuse it depend on the height of tree

## binarysearchtree

* Big O for time is O(log(n)) becuse it depend on the number of the nodes
* Big O for space is O(h) becuse it depend on the height of tree
