# Proplem Domain  : 

Write a function called tree_intersection that takes two binary tree parameters.
return a set of values found in both trees.

## Algorithm 
create a function that take two binary tree as a parameter   
decleare a result variable [] 
create a preorder tree 
chech if the value in the tree is exist wil push it to the result

## Approach & Efficiency
this Challenge take from me 50 min to do tha


   ### - input ----> 2 binary tree
   ###  - output ----> array 

## Big O:

- **Time** O(n2)  >> depends on the height of the tree
- **space** O(n) >> depends on number of elements in the tree
